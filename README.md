# ServerSide
This is the website I have done for my server side web course.

---------------------------------------------------------

1.	Purpose of Web Site

A kind of portfolio of myself. You can know more about me and my friends. You can also contact me or access to my social medias. But unfortunately I didn't come up with a more original idea because I thought that the idea was not important.

MAIN --> The main elements are in all the pages :
•	Footer : The footer is at the end of all pages. It contains the contact details, different links of social medias for instance and the news.
•	Navbar : The navbar is made with bootstrap and is at the top of all the pages. It contains button who send you to other pages.
•	Button who change the color: This button is always in the right button corner of the screen and invert black and white colors.

HOME PAGE --> Here is the purpose of the website. I could be a presentation of a restaurant, an hotel or a company. The text is spaced and clear so that the user can directly understand the purpose. Thanks to javascript, when you arrive on the home page, a popup appears to show you the date of the last time you visited the website (with the cookie)

ABOUT --> There are more information about me (it ca also be detailed information of a company)

CONTACT --> In this section you can send me a mail. I tried to do some php and javascript to make it working but I need to host it on a server.

FRIENDS --> This part is made with buttons : 
•	My friends: Go to a page who show all the information about the person with a photo.
•	Add a new friend: access to a new page with a form where you can add a new friend.

PERSON ADDED --> When the friend  is added thanks to the form, the web site redirect you to this page. It shows a loading bar for 5 seconds and then send you in the HOME page.

404 and 505 --> This pages are here in case there is a server error or an unknow URL. There is a gif of a minion who cry. If you click on it, it will send you to the HOME page.

2.	What you found most difficult about creating the site.


I really like to create pretty things, so I struggled a lot to make everything look good with 3 languages I never used before. The most difficult was to make things responsive I think.
Also, the button who changes the color of the website was very difficult but I found a working method but I’m not satisfied about that. I want to save the choice of the user with a cookie. I will try to create a boolean variable for instance.

---------------------------------------------------------

3.	Elements which are not working


The home page isn’t really responsive due to lack of time (but I will solve it, just need to change some properties in css and add a container taking the text and the animated cube).
The form to send me an email doesn’t work yet because I have to host my website in a server.

---------------------------------------------------------

4.	Any part you want to draw my attention to.


If you look at my code, don't look at the style.css … it's not quite tidy yet but it will be in the future!
